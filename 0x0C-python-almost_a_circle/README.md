0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
	All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
1. Base class
	Write the first class Base:
2. First Rectangle
	the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:
3. Validate attributes
	the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):
4. Area first
	the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
5. Display #0
	the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
6. __str__
	the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
